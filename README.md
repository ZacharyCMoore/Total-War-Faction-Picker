# Total-War-Faction-Picker
This is a work in progress


I found that fonts that I decided to use at 1001freefonts.com

I am planning on implementing some additional features in the future:
  Select game functionality for several additional total war titles (Rome, Medieval 2, and Shogun 2), so the user
  can receive a random faction based on the selected game.
  
  Implement selection between vortex and mortal empires for the Total War Warhammer selection.
  
  Implement an exclude function so that user can remove specific choices from the randomizer.
  
  Implement a function that will display faction/race details.
