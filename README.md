# Total-War-Faction-Picker
This is a work in progress


I found the fonts that I decided to use at 1001freefonts.com
They are: darkdominion, Caviar Dreams, Japanese Style, Old English Five, and Praetoria D.

Changes:
  Implemented a series of .png files that will display faction details.
  Implemented more choices for common Total War games (Medieval II, Shogun II, and Rome).
  Implemented the option to choose between Vortex and Mortal Empires campaigns in the Total War: Warhammer II section.
